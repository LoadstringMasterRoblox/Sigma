Get started by following one of our iOS quick start guides

1. Follow the iOS guide to configure your project and create the codemagic.yaml file.
2. Save the codemagic.yaml file to the project root folder.
3. Push the added file to the repository. From command line:

```
git add codemagic.yaml
git commit -m 'Add first workflow'
git push
```

---

DONE! ✅

The codemagic.yaml file is already in this zip at the root folder.

Just push to GitHub:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PuzzleGame.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then connect your repo to Codemagic.io and click "Start build"!
